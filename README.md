Idea:
Problem: Sometimes I want to share images to my work computer but I don't want to take 3 hours for it to send through email and I don't want to login through my google email to download it to my computer. 

Solution: I want to upload a picture or text to this website. Have the website generate a random access code the user can enter on another device on the website to ascertain the data entered. 

I upload "Bob is cool" to the website. The website returns a random access code like "cW34jf". I input the code on another device and return the data. I can then either copy or paste the data or download it.
### Steps to Build the Solution
1. **Frontend Development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)**:
    - Build a simple interface with:
        - File or text upload input.
        - Button to submit the data.
        - Section to display the generated access code.
2. **Backend Development (Server-Side Logic)**:
    - Use a backend framework like **Node.js** with **Express**, **Python Flask/Django**, or **Ruby on Rails** to handle the upload and storage.
    - When the file or text is uploaded:
        - Store the data temporarily (you can use a database like **MongoDB** or a cloud storage service like **AWS S3**).
        - Generate a random access code (e.g., using a library like `uuid` or creating a random string).
        - Return the access code to the user.
3. **File Storage & Retrieval**:
    - When a user inputs the access code on another device:
        - Query the database for the matching code.
        - Retrieve the associated file or text.
        - Allow the user to download or copy the text.
4. **Security Considerations**:
    - Use **HTTPS** to secure the data transfer.
    - Implement code expiration (e.g., the data is accessible for only 24 hours) or self-deletion after retrieval.
    - Limit file size and type for security and storage management.
