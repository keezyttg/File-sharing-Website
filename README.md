Instant File & Text Sharing

Problem

Sometimes, transferring images or text between devices—especially from a personal device to a work computer—can be a hassle. Email can take too long, and logging into cloud storage can be inconvenient.

Solution

This web application provides a quick and easy way to share images and text between devices without the need for email or cloud logins. Users can upload a file or enter text, and the site generates a random access code. This code can then be used on another device to retrieve the data.

Example Use Case

    Upload "Bob is cool" to the website.

    The website generates an access code like "cW34jf".

    Enter the access code on another device to retrieve the data.

    Copy the text or download the file as needed.
